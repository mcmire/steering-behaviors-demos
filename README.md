# Steering Behaviors Playground

This project is intended to demonstrate various behaviors, commonly known as
steering behaviors, that freely moving objects may exhibit in order to move
around their virtual world in a lifelike manner. All of the techniques here are
adapted from a [paper][reynolds-99] written by [Craig Reynolds][craig-reynolds]
who pioneered such techniques.
